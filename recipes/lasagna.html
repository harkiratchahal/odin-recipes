    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It
      is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made
      from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After
      being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in
      layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a fresh version of lasagna that requires pre-boiling the pasta
      before filling it or adding sauce and then baking. There are also
      commercial versions, however, that allow for spreading the pasta in a
      baking pan and filling it or adding more liquid sauces so that the pasta
      softens during cooking. The sauces may be based on tomatoes and meat,
      cheese, pesto or even vegetables and b√©chamel. On top of it all, there is
      a layer of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and it is baked for a length of
      time that depends on the type of lasagna noodles used.
